Originally wrote this in <2 hours as a challenge. The entire project is <250 lines of code.

Simply upload all files to a server with a modern version of PHP (8+) and you should be good to go. 

Grid state on the server-side is stored in an SQLite file, powered by [StorX](https://github.com/aaviator42/StorX).
